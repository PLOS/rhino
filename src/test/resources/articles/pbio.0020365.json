(A) Each trial began when the monkeys pressed a button to make a fixation point (FP) appear at the center of the video monitor. Some time after the monkeys fixated the FP (dashed lines), a gray circle (depicted here as white) appeared at one of four peripheral locations. The figure illustrates its appearance at the 0° location (part a). The monkeys had to remember this location later in the task; hence we termed it the remembered location. On most trials, the circle subsequently revolved around the FP to a different location, as the monkeys maintained central fixation. The figure illustrates its termination at the 90° location (part b). A small change in the circle\u0027s luminance (part c) signaled the monkeys where to look next. This cue persisted for 150 ms, then disappeared. Because the monkeys depended on this subtle and brief cue for both timing and targeting information, we termed this the attended location. If the circle dimmed (dark gray, part c, top), the monkeys had to make a saccade to the attended location (Att-trials, part d, top). If the circle brightened (starburst, part c, bottom), the monkeys had to make a saccade to the remembered location (Rem-trials, part d, bottom). After saccade initiation, the central FP disappeared and, if the monkeys made a saccade to the correct location, a new FP appeared there (not shown). The monkeys had to fixate the new FP and, after it dimmed, release the button to produce a fruit juice reward. (Monkey drawing courtesy of Dr. Michael Shadlen.)\u003c/p\u003e",

Note that the column-to-column variation in C necessarily results from chance variation because at that time the circle\u0027s final location is unknown.
