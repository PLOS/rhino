(A) Paraoxon potentiated EFS-induced contractions in the trachea with significant effects at 360 nM; paraoxon at 100 and 360 nM significantly potentiated ACh-induced contractions. (B) In contrast, paraoxon did not significantly potentiate either EFS-induced or ACh-induced contractions in the ileum even at concentrations that significantly inhibited AChE activity. (C) Concentrations of physostigmine that significantly inhibited AChE activity to the same degree as paraoxon did not potentiate EFS-induced contractions in the ileum.
