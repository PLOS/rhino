          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Normal airway epithelial barrier function is maintained by cell-cell contacts which require the translocation of adhesion proteins at the cell surface, through membrane vesicle trafficking and fusion events. Myoferlin and dysferlin, members of the multiple-C2-domain Ferlin superfamily, have been implicated in membrane fusion processes through the induction of membrane curvature. The objectives of this study were to examine the expression of dysferlin and myoferlin within the human airway and determine the roles of these proteins in airway epithelial homeostasis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>The expression of dysferlin and myoferlin were evaluated in normal human airway sections by immunohistochemistry, and primary human airway epithelial cells and fibroblasts by immuno blot. Localization of dysferlin and myoferlin in epithelial cells were determined using confocal microscopy. Functional outcomes analyzed included cell adhesion, protein expression, and cell detachment following dysferlin and myoferlin siRNA knock-down, using the human bronchial epithelial cell line, 16HBE.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Primary human airway epithelial cells express both dysferlin and myoferlin whereas fibroblasts isolated from bronchi and the parenchyma only express myoferlin. Expression of dysferlin and myoferlin was further localized within the Golgi, cell cytoplasm and plasma membrane of 16HBE cells using confocal micrscopy. Treatment of 16HBE cells with myoferlin siRNA, but not dysferlin siRNA, resulted in a rounded cell morphology and loss of cell adhesion. This cell shedding following myoferlin knockdown was associated with decreased expression of tight junction molecule, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and increased number of cells positive for apoptotic markers Annexin V and propidium iodide. Cell shedding was not associated with release of the innate inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>This study demonstrates the heterogeneous expression of myoferlin within epithelial cells and fibroblasts of the respiratory airway. The effect of myoferlin on the expression of ZO-1 in airway epithelial cells indicates its role in membrane fusion events that regulate cell detachment and apoptosis within the airway epithelium.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The airway epithelium forms a continuous, highly regulated physical barrier, which lines the airway lumen, separating the underlying tissue from inhaled environmental antigens. Intercellular epithelial junctions form the structural adhesive forces that maintain the airway epithelial barrier, and are comprised of tight junctions (TJs), adherens junctions (AJs) and desmosomes. AJs mechanically connect adjacent cells and initiate the proliferation and differentiation of cell-cell contacts through homotypic transmembrane E-cadherin adhesions, which are anchored to the actin cytoskeleton and microtubule network by p120 catenin, β-catenin, and α-catenin. TJs are considered the main regulators of paracellular permeability and movement of ions and solutes between cells and are composed of transmembrane proteins such as junction-adhesion-molecules (JAM)s, occludin, and claudins 1–20 which anchor to the cytoskeleton by zonula occludens (ZO)-1, -2, -3 or cingulin. Desmosomes consist of non-classical cadherins that form adhesive bonds between the filament cytoskeleton of epithelial cells, and the lamina propria.</p>
      <p>Fusion of cytoplasmic vesicles containing adhesion molecules to the plasma membrane is essential for the formation of selectively permeable membrane barriers. As there is an energy barrier to the fusion process, membrane-fusion events generally require molecules that tether and dock membranes into close proximity of one another (&lt;5–10 nm). Lipid vesicle fusion involves numerous factors, including ferlins, SNAREs and synaptotagmins, to facilitate the fusion of membrane vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Bi1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Washington1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Steinhardt1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Ullrich1">[4]</xref>. In humans (mammals), six ferlin proteins have been identified to date based on their structural similarities and sequence homologies to fer-1; they are dysferlin (Fer1L1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Bashir1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Liu1">[6]</xref>, otoferlin (Fer1L2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Yasunaga1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Yasunaga2">[8]</xref>, myoferlin (Fer1L3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Britton1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Davis1">[10]</xref>, Fer1L4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Lek1">[11]</xref>, Fer1L5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Posey1">[12]</xref> and Fer1L6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Lek1">[11]</xref>. Each ferlin protein contains a transmembrane domain at the carboxyl terminal which acts as a membrane-anchor and multiple C2 domains, with Ca2+-binding motifs that exhibit a wide range of functions such as phospholipid-binding, signaling and membrane trafficking. The majority of our understanding of mammalian ferlin proteins has come from studies focusing on dysferlin, as mutations in the dysferlin gene lead to limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Bashir1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Liu1">[6]</xref>. Patients with dysferlinopathy are often diagnosed with defective membrane fusion events in skeletal muscles and the release of surplus vesicles, the contents of which contribute to inflammation and further damage of skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Selcen1">[13]</xref>. Although functions of myoferlin are less well known, sequencing of the gene revealed that it is highly homologous to dysferlin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Britton1">[9]</xref>. In addition, myoferlin has been reported to be responsible for fusion of myoblasts during muscle development and its mutations result in muscle atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Doherty1">[14]</xref>. Although dysferlin and myoferlin are highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles, studies have confirmed their expression in kidney, placenta, lung, and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Davis1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Anderson1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Vandre1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Izzedine1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Hochmeister1">[18]</xref>. We have previously demonstrated that dysferlin and myoferlin are present in the caveolae-enriched membrane lipid rafts, isolated from vascular endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Sharma1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Bernatchez1">[20]</xref>. Importantly, this work also demonstrated that targeted knockdown of dysferlin and myoferlin led to decreased cell proliferation and adhesion through down-regulation of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 2 (VEGFR-2) respectively, in vascular endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Sharma1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Bernatchez1">[20]</xref>. Similar to the vascular endothelium, the airway epithelium also forms a continuous epithelial sheet on top of a basement membrane. Since dysferlin and myoferlin are membrane repair proteins that are crucial for maintaining membrane integrity, we sort to determine whether these proteins have a functional role in the homeostasis of human airway epithelium. The purpose of this study was thus to examine the expression of dysferlin and myoferlin within the human airway and determine the effects of myoferlin and dysferlin knockdown on airway epithelial functions.</p>

Briefly, bronchi to the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation were dissected and then rinsed with cold PBS without calcium and magnesium three times to remove blood and mucus. Epithelial layers on intact segments of bronchi (2–4 cm in length) were dissociated at 4°C for 16 hours (h) in 100 ml of MEM (Fisher Scientific) containing 1.4 mg/ml Pronase and 0.1 mg/ml of DNase (Roche Diagnostics). Dissociated epithelial cells were strained through a 70 µm nylon mesh (Becton-Dickison). Cells were then re-suspended and incubated in MEM supplemented with 10%FBS for 10 minutes and washed twice with MEM by centrifugation at 4°C to neutralize the pronase. Cells were then seeded in tissue culture flasks and incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere with bronchial epithelial growth media (Cambrex) until confluent monolayers were formed.</p>

Briefly, bronchial and parenchymal tissue from the same lung were dissected into 2 mm<sup>3</sup> size explants and 4–5 explants placed into the well of 6-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences) with 0.75 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37°C with 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Media was replaced every two days to remove tissue debris and non-adherent cells. After seven days tissue explants were removed and the outgrowth of fibroblasts were maintained until a confluent monolayer was formed. Total protein from both primary epithelial cell and fibroblast cultures was extracted as described under the immunoblot procedures below.</p>

After 8 hours of transfection, the transfection media was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin for 72 h after which cells were lysed in protein extraction buffer. Spent cell culture media for each treatment condition was collected to determine the number of detached and dead cells using trypan blue staining and a hemocytometer. To quantify the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis, we used the flurescein isothiocyanate Annexin V and propidium iodide apoptosis detection kit I as per the manufacturer’s instructions (BD Pharmingen) and cells were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry using a BD LSRII machine and flow cytometry analysis was performed using DiVa software.</p>

Detection was performed with IR700 anti-mouse and IR800 anti-rabbit antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) and the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln, Nebraska) using a manufacturer’s protocol. Density of the bands was analyzed with Odyssey software 1.1 (LI-COR Biotechnology) using two infrared channels independently. The results are expressed as protein of interest/β-tubulin or HSP-90 density ratio.</p>

        <p>We hypothesized that the morphological changes and cell detachment observed in epithelial cells treated with myoferlin siRNA may indicate loss of cell adhesion. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the expression of adherens junction molecule, E-cadherin, as well as tight junction molecules occuldin, claudin-1, ZO-1 and extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion receptor integrin β1 during knockdown of dysferlin and myoferlin. Dysferlin knockdown did not result in cell detachment; and as expected, we did not detect any difference in the expression of any of the adhesion proteins measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040478-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

      <p>Under normal circumstances, the polarized airway epithelium forms a highly regulated and semi-permeable barrier through the formation of cell-cell adhesions. The formation of these cell-cell adhesion junctions requires the coordinated fusion and exocytosis of vesicles containing adhesion molecules at targeted areas within the cell plasma membrane. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that membrane fusion proteins of the ferlin family, dysferlin and myoferlin, are expressed within airway epithelial cells of the human lung. Furthermore, we demonstrate that down-regulation of myoferlin, but not dysferlin using siRNA, results in loss of epithelial tight junction protein ZO-1 expression, cell detachment and apoptosis.</p>
      <p>Sorting of cell membrane-associated proteins occurs predominantly in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network in both polarized epithelia and “non-polarized” fibroblasts through well-defined cytoplasmic domain-sorting signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Yoshimori1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Keller1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Mostov1">[30]</xref> and specialized organization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton beneath the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Bennett1">[31]</xref>. During membrane fusion, a membrane bound structure fuses with the plasma membrane and expels its contents to the exterior. The fusion mechanisms involved include aggregation of the membranes, resulting in close bilayer apposition; destabilization and rupture of the membrane; and merging of the aqueous contents and membrane components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Folsch1">[32]</xref>. This fusion of vesicles within a target plasma membrane is regulated by organelle-specific Rab GTPases, vesicle-tethering complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Grosshans1">[33]</xref> and SNAREs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Rothman1">[34]</xref>. Ferlin family members are known to mediate membrane fusion events upon membrane damage, endocytosis and exocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Bernatchez2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Beurg1">[35]</xref>. Ferlins anchor to the plasma membrane via a single C-terminal transmembrane domain and contain C2 domains that mediate lipid and protein binding. Both dysferlin and myoferlin contain C2 domains which can coordinate calcium ions within a negatively charged binding pocket to regulate calcium-activated events, akin to the well characterized classical mediators of vesicle fusion, the synaptotagmins, which contain two C2 domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Sutton1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Sudhof1">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The roles of dysferlin and myoferlin in membrane fusion events have primarily focused on skeletal muscles, as mutations particularly in the dysferlin gene are associated with the development of muscular dystrophy, a muscle wasting disease. Since then, dysferlin and myoferlin have also been demonstrated to be expressed in a number of other cell types including myoblasts, inflammatory cells, endothelial cells and specialized epithelium of the placenta, renal tubular and glomerular structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Vandre1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Robinson1">[38]</xref>. Here, we report that dysferlin and myoferlin are expressed in the airway epithelium at similar levels to vascular endothelial cells whereas bronchial and lung fibroblasts only express myoferlin. We observed that the sub-cellular distribution of dysferlin and myoferlin within airway epithelial cells is localized to the Golgi-membrane, cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Furthermore, this staining was punctate in appearance, suggesting expression was localized to vesicles. Previous studies have reported low expression levels of dysferlin and myoferlin in human lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Davis1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Anderson1">[15]</xref>, but these studies did not investigate the expression of these proteins in specific cell types.</p>
      <p>To determine the function of dysferlin and myoferlin within the airway epithelial cells, we used specific siRNAs to knock down protein expression. Down-regulation of myoferlin, but not dysferlin, resulted in loss of cuboidal epithelium and acquisition of a spindle-shape morphology. In addition, the numbers of detached cells within cultures also significantly increased following myoferlin knockdown when compared to dysferlin and control conditions. We have previously demonstrated dysferlin knockdown impairs the proliferation, migration and adhesion of sub-confluent vascular endothelial cells through loss of the adhesion molecule, PECAM-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Sharma1">[19]</xref>. Whereas myoferlin knock down led to a decrease in vascular endothelial cell proliferation, and migration that was associated with decreased expression of VEGFR-2, the receptor of vascular endothelial growth factor, an important molecule in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Bernatchez1">[20]</xref>. In addition dysferlin and myoferlin have been shown to interact with caveoli-1n in lipid rafts of endothelial cells, skeletal muscle and fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Bernatchez2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Matsuda1">[39]</xref>. As PECAM-1 is not expressed on epithelial cells, we quantified the expression of VEGFR-2 and caveolin-1 in airway epithelial cells. We expected that knockdown of dysferlin and myoferlin may stimulate a compensatory response on caveolin-1 in airway epithelial cells. However, we did not see any difference in the expression of caveolin-1, suggesting that dysferlin and myoferlin have tissue or cell-specific functions. Interestingly, although we observed that down-regulation of myoferlin in airway epithelial cells was not associated with VEGFR-2 expression, it was associated with the loss of TJ protein, ZO-1. This finding further suggests that dysferlin and myoferlin may have different regulatory roles of membrane-associated proteins in different tissues. Interestingly, myoferlin associated down-regulation of ZO-1 and cell detachment was not associated with expression changes in the other transmembrane TJ and AJ proteins analyzed, which included occludin, claudin 1 and E-cadherin. In support of our findings, it has recently been shown in the mouse jejunum epithelium that the process of cell shedding requires redistribution of ZO-1 prior to cell extrusion and that shed epithelial cells undergo nuclear chromatin condensation, a hallmark of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Watson1">[40]</xref>. This study and others suggest that ZO-1 rearranges beneath dividing and shedding cells to maintain epithelial barrier function by connecting neighboring cells surrounding an extruding cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Baron1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Bullen1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Jinguji1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Marchiando1">[44]</xref>. Thus, loss of ZO-1 expression via down-regulation of myoferlin expression may be an active participant in catalyzing cell extrusion. This would support our findings of increased numbers of epithelial cells positive for annexin V and PI staining, which are markers for apoptosis, within cultures treated with myoferlin siRNA. As calcium-dependent intercellular adhesion is required for ZO-1 localization to the TJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Anderson2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Siliciano1">[46]</xref>, we propose that in epithelial homeostasis, the multiple C2-calcium binding domains of myoferlin may play an important role in regulating the graduated fusion in response to gradients of calcium release, for vesicle trafficking. In support of our hypothesis, recent studies have shown that myoferlin forms a protein complex with dynamin 2 (Dyn-2) that is essential for the fission of endocytic vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Takei1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Hinshaw1">[48]</xref> and that tight junctional proteins mislocalize and cell polarity is lost upon Dyn-2 depletion, suggesting a dynamin-myoferlin mediated endocytic pathway maybe involved in the spatial regulation and distribution of tight junction proteins and their binding partners.</p>
      <p>Tight junctions are responsible for regulating paracellular permeability and maintaining cell polarity, which are often referred to as “barrier” and “fence” function, respectively. TJs also play a role in signaling pathways involved in epithelial proliferation, gene expression and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Arakawa1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Matter1">[50]</xref>. ZO-1 via its SH3 domain, binds ZONAB (ZO-1-associated nucleic-acid-binding protein) a Y-box transcription factor, sequestering it in the cytoplasm and inhibiting its transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Arakawa1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Matter1">[50]</xref>. Following disassembly of ZO-1 from the tight junction, ZONAB is able to interact with the cell cycle kinase cdk4 to regulate the transcription of cell cycle genes including cyclin D1 and PCNA, which lead to the proliferation of epithelial cells in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Balda1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Balda2">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Sourisseau1">[53]</xref>. ZO-1 expression has been shown to be localized both at the cell membrane, within the cell cytoplasm and nucleus in dividing cells. These data support our co-localization of ZO-1 and myoferlin by confocal microscopy as both proteins were found with the cytoplasm and cell membrane. Myoferlin has been shown previously to be ubiquitously expressed in developing skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Davis1">[10]</xref> and caveolae-enriched buoyant lipid rafts in endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Bernatchez1">[20]</xref>. Interestingly, myoferlin shows developmental ‘switching’ in skeletal muscle as it is highly expressed in proliferating mononuclear cells and becomes downregulated with myogenic maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Patel1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Kuru1">[55]</xref>. In contrast, dysferlin is expressed at low levels in proliferative myoblasts, and becomes robustly expressed in fused myotubes and in mature muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040478-Patel1">[54]</xref>. This suggests that myoferlin and dysferlin may possess both overlapping and specialized roles, with functional specialization related to distinct requirements of proliferative and differentiated cells. In our study, we found that myoferlin and to a limited extent dysferlin was expressed ubiquitously within basal, ciliated and mucus expressing cells within normal human airway epithelium. However our study does not investigate the expression and localization of myoferlin and dysferlin following epithelial proliferation or repair or the compensatory responses by other multiple C2 domain protein family members, in the absence of either protein. Future studies in our laboratory are aimed at unraveling the mechanisms by which myoferlin regulates ZO-1 expression during epithelial damage.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study provides evidence that dysferlin and myoferlin are present in several cell types within the human airway. Furthermore, down-regulation of myoferlin in airway epithelial cells triggers loss of ZO-1 expression, cell shedding and apoptosis. These <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data thus demonstrate that myoferlin in airway epithelial cells may play a role in maintaining epithelial homeostasis through trafficking of tight junction protein ZO-1. Future studies are required to understand the potential roles of myoferlin during epithelial repair.</p>
