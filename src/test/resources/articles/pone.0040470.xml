        <p>Mitochondrial carriers (MC) form a highly conserved family involved in
solute transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes. In
mammals, ATP-Mg/Pi carriers, SCaMCs, form the most complex subgroup with four
paralogs, SCaMC-1, -2, -3 and -3L, and several splicing variants. Here, we
report the tissue distribution and subcellular localization of a mammalian-specific
SCaMC paralog, <italic>4930443G12Rik/SCaMC-1Like</italic> (<italic>SCaMC-1L</italic>),
which displays unanticipated new features. SCaMC-1L proteins show higher amino
acid substitution rates than its closest paralog SCaMC-1. In mouse, SCaMC-1L
expression is restricted to male germ cells and regulated during spermatogenesis
but unexpectedly its localization is not limited to mitochondrial structures.
In mature spermatids SCaMC-1L is detected in the mitochondrial sheath but
in previous differentiation stages appears associated to cytosolic granules
which colocalize with specific markers of the chromatoid body (CB) in post-meiotic
round spermatids and inter-mitochondrial cement (IMC) in spermatocytes. The
origin of this atypical distribution was further investigated by transient
expression in cell lines. Similarly to male germ cells, in addition to mitochondrial
and cytosolic distribution, a fraction of SCaMC-1L-expressing COS-7 cells
display cytosolic SCaMC-1L-aggregates which exhibit aggresomal-like features
as the CB. Our results indicate that different regions of SCaMC-1L hinder
its import into mitochondria and this apparently favours the formation of
cytosolic aggregates in COS-7 cells. This mechanism could be also operational
in male germ cells and explain the incorporation of SCaMC-1L into germinal
granules.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Mitochondrial carrier (MC) family (SLC25) is a highly represented group
of solute transporters in eukaryotic cells. Members of MC family (MCF) perform
the transport of metabolites, nucleotides and cofactors across the inner mitochondrial
membrane (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Palmieri1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-delArco1">[3]</xref>). The MCF
shows increased complexity in pluricellular eukaryotes, mainly as a consequence
of the generation of novel paralogs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-delArco1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Traba1">[6]</xref> and, to a lesser
extent, by the emergence of proteins with new transport capabilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-delArco1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Hughes1">[7]</xref>. Gene duplication events have
contributed as the major source of MCF functional diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-delArco1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Szklarczyk1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Palmieri2">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In mammals, the most expanded subfamilies of MCs are those involved in
adenine nucleotide transport; the ADP/ATP translocases (AACs) and SCaMCs,
the ATP-Mg/Pi carriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Fiermonte1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Traba2">[11]</xref>. ATP-Mg/Pi
carriers mediate a reversible electroneutral exchange between ATP-Mg<sup>2−</sup>
and HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Aprille1">[12]</xref>
and control the net transport of adenine nucleotides across the inner mitochondrial
membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Aprille1">[12]</xref>.
SCaMCs belong to a MC sub-group containing N-terminal extensions with EF-hand
calcium-binding motifs (CaMC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Satrstegui1">[13]</xref>).
A single SCaMCs counterpart, Sal1p, is found in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Traba3">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Cavero1">[15]</xref>
while four paralogs, with several splicing variants, SCaMC-1, -2, -3 and -3L,
have been identified in human and rodent genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Traba1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Fiermonte1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-delArco2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Satrstegui1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-delArco3">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Haitina1">[17]</xref>.
Both subfamilies have paralogs expressed specifically in testis, SCaMC-3L
and AAC4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Brower1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Traba1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Dolce1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Kim1">[19]</xref>.
Interestingly, inactivation of <italic>Aac4</italic> in mouse causes spermatogenesis
arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Brower2">[20]</xref>
indicating that ATP supply from mitochondria may be critical for normal male
germ cell differentiation.</p>
      <p>Mammalian spermatogenesis is an intricate process of cellular differentiation
performed by numerous testis and/or germ cell specific genes. A number of
ultrastructural studies have revealed that mitochondria of germinal cells
undergo changes in their appearance, location and number during spermatogenesis
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Seitz1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Aihara1">[22]</xref> and references
therein). Additionally, mitochondria participate in the formation of the chromatoid
body (CB), a male germ cell-specific perinuclear granule formed by aggregates
of electron-dense material involved in the control of mRNA stability and translation,
and in processing of small RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Parvinen1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Chuma1">[27]</xref>. In mouse,
the CB appears for the first time in the cytoplasm of meiotic spermatocytes
in the interstices of mitochondrial clusters, named inter-mitochondrial cement
(IMC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Chuma1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Fawcett1">[28]</xref>, being condensed
after meiosis to one single perinuclear granule placed at the surface of the
haploid nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Fawcett1">[28]</xref>.
Consequently, several mitochondrial proteins have been detected as components
of CBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Hess1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Haraguchi2">[31]</xref>. Furthermore,
recent reports have shown that signaling from mitochondria influences the
formation of the IMC and promotes mitochondrial clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Huang1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Watanabe1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we report the tissue distribution and subcellular localization
of a fifth SCaMC paralog, 4930443G12Rik/SCaMC-1Like (SCaMC-1L), expressed
in male germ cells which represents a new link between mitochondria and germinal
granules. SCaMC-1L is detected in the mitochondrial sheath of mature spermatids,
but its intracellular location varies in a stage-specific fashion during spermatogenesis,
being present in germinal granules, IMC and CB, in spermatocytes and post-meiotic
spermatids. By ectopic expression in cell lines we have reproduced this complex
distribution and analysed the mechanisms involved in the formation of cytosolic
SCaMC-1L aggregates.</p>

        <p>In mouse, TBLATN searches using human SCaMC-1 as query detected a predicted
gene adjacent to SCaMC-1 5′ end, <italic>4930443G12Rik</italic>, whose
product showed high similarity, 78% and 75% at the amino acid
level to human and mouse SCaMC-1, respectively (SLC25A24 and slc25a24, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This <italic>SCaMC-1</italic>
like gene, hereafter referred as <italic>SCaMC-1Like</italic> (<italic>SCaMC-1L</italic>),
encoded a predicted protein of 473 amino acids which displayed four calcium-binding
motifs at identical positions to those of mouse SCaMC-1 and a carboxyl-terminal
half similar to the MCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g001">Figure
1B</xref>). The amino acid changes, compared to mouse SCaMC-1, were scattered
throughout the protein and there was a relative abundance of conservative
substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).
Its genomic organization matches that of mouse <italic>SCaMC-1</italic>, with
10 exons and identical exon/intron boundaries. Both genes, separated by a
short intergenic region were oriented in the same direction, suggesting that
they could have arisen by a tandem duplication event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In the rat genome, a <italic>SCaMC-1L</italic>
ortholog, <italic>LOC691448</italic>, was also found immediately upstream
to <italic>slc25a24</italic>. <italic>LOC691448</italic> encoded a predicted
protein of 473 amino acids, annotated as similar to slc25a24, and is 83%
identical in amino acid sequence to mouse SCaMC-1L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g001">Figure
1B</xref>). Both murine SCaMC-1L orthologs conserved the residues proposed
to be involved in substrate interaction in the ATP-Mg/Pi carriers at equivalent
positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Robinson1">[34]</xref> suggesting

corroborated that the ancestor duplication probably occurred in mammals after
the divergence of the monotreme lineage. Thus, mammalian SCaMC-1L and SCaMC-1
orthologs formed two independent and well-defined clusters whose last common
ancestor was the platypus SCaMC-1 ortholog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g001">Figure
1C</xref>). In addition, this analysis indicated that a different rate of
amino acid substitutions existed inside each cluster, with longer branches
leading to SCaMC-1L than to SCaMC-1 orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g001">Figure
1C</xref>). To detect differences in the pattern of sequence substitutions
between <italic>SCaMC-1</italic> and <italic>-1L</italic> genes, we calculated
non-synonymous (<italic>Ka</italic>) and synonymous (<italic>Ks</italic>)
nucleotide substitution rates by pairwise comparisons between representative
mammalian orthologues using the codeml program implemented in the PAML package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Yang1">[35]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040470.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The <italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic>
ratio is commonly used as indicator of selective constraints on the protein-coding
genes with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> = 1, &lt;1 and &gt;1
indicating neutral evolution, purifying and positive selection, respectively.
Among <italic>SCaMC-1</italic> orthologs we found a very low pairwise <italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic>
ratio, 0.055±0.012 (average ± SEM), indicative of a strong purifying
selection. As anticipated, the average pairwise <italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic>
ratio found among <italic>SCaMC-1L</italic> orthologs was significantly larger
than this of <italic>SCaMC-1</italic>, 0.392±0.085 (average ±
SEM; paired t-test; p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040470.s001">Figure
S1</xref>). This greater <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratio for <italic>SCaMC-1L</italic>
genes was due to increased non-synonymous substitutions rate, <italic>Ka</italic>,
which was 4.8 fold larger than for <italic>SCaMC-1</italic> ones (0.166±0.036 <italic>vs</italic>
0.034±0.007) whereas that synonymous substitutions, <italic>Ks</italic>,
value appeared only slightly lower among <italic>SCaMC-1L</italic>, 0.427±0.093,
than for <italic>SCaMC-1</italic> genes, 0.600±0.131), indicating that
SCaMC-1L appears to be subjected to reduced evolutionary pressure to maintain
conserved residues compared to SCaMC-1.</p>

        <p>Spermatogenesis occurs in synchronized cycles within the seminiferous epithelia.
In mouse, the seminiferous epithelial cycle is divided into twelve stages
(I-XII) where each stage comprises a mix of cells at certain developmental
steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040470.s002">Figure
S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Russell1">[37]</xref>).
During the first wave of spermatogenesis, germ cells are synchronized in their
development, and the different cell types appear progressively at different
post-natal days. At postnatal day (PND) 7 only spermatogonia and Sertoli cells
are present in the seminiferous tubules, primary spermatocytes appear at PND
10, while pachytene spermatocytes are not present until PND 18. After meiosis,
haploid round spermatids start to differentiate to mature sperm at PND 20 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Russell1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Bellv1">[38]</xref>. To study the developmental
pattern of SCaMC-1L in testis, the expression of SCaMC-1L in developing male
germ cells was analyzed by western blot in testis extracts at different post-natal
times, between 15–25 days, and in 3-month-old mice. No significant expression
was observed at PND 15 and 17, and a gradual increase in SCaMC-1L levels was
observed from PND 18 to 20, reaching adult levels at PND 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This temporal pattern indicates
that SCaMC-1L expression could be limited to meiotic and post-meiotic phases
of spermatogenesis (from PND 18 onwards, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Bellv1">[38]</xref>)
first appearing in pachytene spermatocytes at PND 18. The increase in SCaMC-1L
levels at PND 25 corresponds to the time at which the emergence of haploid
round spermatids has taken place <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Bellv1">[38]</xref>.
These results are consistent with microarray data in GEO database (GEO profile
GDS2390) showing that in developing testes SCaMC-1L-expression is first detected
in pachytene spermatocytes and later increased in round spermatids. In early
stages, at PND 18, SCaMC-1L was detected as a single faint band larger than
50 kDa, but later, at PND 19–20, an additional smaller product of approx.
50 kDa, was observed which remained as the major band at PND 25 and adult
testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, asterisk).</p>

        <p>To determine its cellular distribution along spermatogenesis, we performed
immunofluorescence analysis on squash preparations of seminiferous tubules
as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Kotaja3">[39]</xref>
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g003">Figures 3B–E</xref>).
As expected by its absence in early post-natal stages, no expression of SCaMC-1L
was observed in spermatogonia or Sertoli cells (not shown). SCaMC-1L was detected
in meiotic spermatocytes and in all post-meiotic stages, but, unexpectedly,
we found that its intracellular localization suffered dynamic changes during
spermiogenesis. SCaMC-1L protein was detected in late pachytene spermatocytes
(LP) at stages VII–IX of the seminiferous epithelial cycle in cytosolic
granules adjacent, but not coincident, to COX-I positive mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, marked with asterisks).
The appearance of these granular structures was similar to that described
for the inter-mitochondrial cement in meiotic spermatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Fawcett1">[28]</xref>. In haploid round spermatids
(RS) at stages II–IV, which were identified by the presence of heterochromatic
chromocenter (CC) within the nucleus, significant SCaMC-1L immunoreactivity
was detected in a compact structure juxtaposed to the nuclear envelope similar
to the chromatoid body (CB, arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g003">Figure
3C</xref>). Notably, it has been proposed that CB is formed, at least in part,
from the accretion of cytoplasmic granules previously aggregated in the vicinity
of mitochondria in pachytene spermatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Chuma1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Fawcett1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Huang1">[32]</xref>. Later, after the onset of
CB disappearance at step 8 of spermiogenesis, SCaMC-1L-specific signals were
detected in the remains of CB and as a speckled staining spread through the
cytosol and nucleus (see inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g003">Figure
3B</xref>, arrowhead). In successive stages, when the remainder of CB migrates
to the caudal end in early elongating spermatids (EES) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Fawcett1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Shang1">[40]</xref>,
only the nuclear staining remained apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g003">Figure
3D</xref>). However, in elongated spermatids (ES) at stages VII–VIII,
as in mature epididymal spermatozoa, SCaMC-1L co-localized with COX-I in the
mitochondrial sheath of midpiece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g003">Figure
3E</xref>).</p>
        <p>In parallel, SCaMC-1L distribution was analyzed by the drying-down technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Kotaja3">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Peters1">[41]</xref>. Using this procedure the
cytoplasm is partially lost, exposing the chromatoid body, which usually stays
in contact with the nucleus along with some cytosolic organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Kotaja3">[39]</xref>. In these preparations, SCaMC-1L
staining was also found associated to structures reminiscent of inter-mitochondrial
cement in pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g004">Figure
4A</xref>, asterisks) and CB in round spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g004">Figure
4B</xref>). In EES, in addition to structures derived from the CB (arowheads),
a diffuse SCaMC-1L staining was also detected in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) which remained until the latest
steps of spermatid differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g004">Figures
4D, 4E</xref>). However in ES, at the end of spermiogenesis after mitochondrial
disposition around the flagellum, SCaMC-1L-positive signals appeared again
restricted to the midpiece showing total co-localization with COX-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). We confirmed by
phase-contrast microscopy that SCaMC-1L staining was entirely coincident with
the dense material associated to the nuclear envelope distinctive of CB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Sderstrm1">[42]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, by
double immunostaining we confirmed its co-localization with eIF4E, a P-body
marker found in the CB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Kotaja1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Tanaka1">[43]</xref>, and MVH

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g005">Figure 5</xref>,
SCaMC-1L-signals matched entirely with those of eIF4E and MVH in RS, confirming
its location in the CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g005">Figures

coincident with MVH-positive granules indicating its presence in the IMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). These MVH-positives

by western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).
Therefore, ectopic expression of SCaMC-1L in cultured cells generated different
intracellular patterns, as in male germ cells, in contrast to the exclusive
mitochondrial location shown by its closest paralog, SCaMC-1, and by other
CaMCs overexpressed in cells lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Traba1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Fiermonte1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-delArco2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-delArco4">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-delArco5">[47]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In SCaMC-1L-expressing cells containing cytoplasmic SCaMC-1L granules two
major patterns were clearly distinguished; i) cells showing small, vesicular,
filamentous or cup-shaped aggregates scattered throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, arrows), which sometimes
appeared grouped in reticular arrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g006">Figure
6E</xref>, asterisks), and ii) cells showing larger and more intense SCaMC-1L-positive
accumulations, which occasionally formed large honeycomb-like structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040470.s004">Figure S4</xref>),
located at the perinuclear area and co-clustered with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). These patterns were
not independent but occurred sequentially. Thus, in SCaMC-1L-positive cells
disperse granules were observed early, at 6–8 h post-transfection, whereas
perinuclear aggregations, showing more intense signals, emerged later, suggesting
that the latter were originated by fusion of dispersed granules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040470.s009">movie S1</xref>). Interestingly, disperse SCaMC-1L-positive
granules were usually observed very close to mitochondria, an arrangement
reminiscent of the inter-mitochondrial cement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g006">Figure
6E</xref>, arrowheads). In these cells, mitochondria appeared punctuated rather
than filamentous, indicating that mitochondrial morphology could also be affected
(compare COX-positive mitochondria in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g006">Figures
6E and 6F</xref> with that in 6G). In addition, we find a total absence of
co-location with CD63 and Lysotracker indicating that SCaMC-1L-positive structures
did not belong to the late endosomal/lysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040470.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Taken together, our results suggest that ectopic SCaMC-1L are not successfully
imported into mitochondria and it is possible that the excess of unfolded
(and possibly unprocessed) cytosolic SCaMC-1L may favour the formation of
small cytosolic granules that are later assembled in larger perinuclear aggregates.
It should be noted that this mechanism could be also operational in male germ
cells and to contribute to CB formation during spermatogenesis. Similarly,
TDRD4/RNF17, a component of mammalian germinal granules, forms large cytosolic
granules when is transfected in cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Pan1">[48]</xref>.</p>

Among other aspects, aggresomes have been characterized as inclusion bodies

that the large perinuclear aggregates found in SCaMC-1L-expressing cells were
reminiscent of aggresomes. First, perinuclear aggregates were located in the
vicinity of the MTOC, as indicated by their proximity to centrosomal γ-tubulin
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, marked by
arrow). Second, its formation depended on dynein-dependent transport, as was
inferred from the loss of SCaMC-1L perinuclear aggregates upon treatment with
nocodazole (Noc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g007">Figures 7B,

at the percentage of SCaMC-1L-expressing cells with perinuclear aggregates,

after 4 hours of Noc incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g007">Figure

protein could be modified by ubiquitination or form complexes with ubiquitinated
proteins. However, we were not able to detect ubiquitination of SCaMC-1L itself
by immunoblotting, indicating that ubiquitin may modify other associated proteins.

        <p>However, regardless of its higher frequency of mitochondrial location, ΔNT<sub>(1–160)</sub>-SCaMC-1L

but did not determine the formation of cytosolic aggregates. To study the
role of the hydrophobic carboxy-terminal half of SCaMC-1L, we constructed
chimeric proteins containing portions from SCaMC-1L and from human SCaMC-1
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). When expressed
in COS-7 cells, we found that the C-terminal half of SCaMC-1 (Chimera-1, 1L<sub>1–184</sub>-huSCaMC-1<sub>185–476</sub>)
conferred a predominantly mitochondrial distribution, while the C-terminal
half of SCaMC-1L (Chimera-2, hu1<sub>1–184</sub>-SCaMC-1L<sub>185–473</sub>)
caused a frequent localization in non-mitochondrial aggregates (more than
80%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g008">Figure 8C</xref>).
Moreover, the frequency of non-mitochondrial aggregates diminished with the
length of SCaMC-1L C-half in the chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g008">Figure
8C</xref>). In addition, distal and proximal regions of the C-terminal half
did not affect equally to its intracellular distribution. Thus, residues 185–362
of SCaMC-1L present in Chimera-4 were more prone to promote the formation
of cytosolic aggregates than the region covering the two last transmembrane
domains, residues 363 to C-end, which favored its presence in mitochondria
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Taken together,
these results suggest that both the hydrophilic N-extension and the most distal
C-end regions of SCaMC-1L prevent its targeting to mitochondria while the
proximal C-domain, residues 185–362, might provide aggregation-prone
features to SCaMC-1L.</p>

restricted to male germ cells and during spermatogenesis it showed a surprising

        <title>Determinants of the subcellular distribution of SCaMC-1L</title>
        <p>Our data indicate that the anomalous distribution of SCaMC-1L in male germ
cells was a property depending on the sequence of SCaMC-1L itself. Ectopic
expression of SCaMC-1L in cell lines revealed that SCaMC-1L had a difficulty
in mitochondrial import. This was not due to artefacts of overexpression,
as it was observed even when it was expressed at very low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g006">Figures 6A, 6B</xref>). We analyzed in more detail
the determinants for the lack of mitochondrial localization of SCaMC-1L and
found that mitochondrial import of SCaMC-1L was partially hampered by its
hydrophilic N-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g008">Figures
8A, 8B</xref>). A reversal of incomplete mitochondrial import by N-terminal
domain removal has been also described for other CaMCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-delArco3">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Roesch1">[56]</xref>.
Roesch and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Roesch1">[56]</xref>
have suggested that CaMCs interact in their pass across the intermembrane
space with small Tim proteins different from those used by MCs lacking hydrophilic
N-extensions, and this could account the different effectiveness observed
in their import. Moreover, the faulty import of SCaMC-1L is not caused solely
by its N-extension, as amino acids 185–362 within the hydrophobic SCaMC-1L
carboxyl-half also impaired its import in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). We can not rule out that SCaMC-1L
may require additional factors to be inserted into mitochondria. Thus, it
has been reported that apocytochrome c<sub>T</sub> is less readily taken up
by mitochondria <italic>in vitro</italic> than the c<sub>S</sub> isoform and
that specific stage-specific factors may be required to facilitate its import
into mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Hess1">[29]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our findings suggest that the apparent difficulty of SCaMC-1L to be imported,
along with its expression levels, are important factors causing the formation
of cytosolic aggregates. In fact, inefficient translocation through the IMS
and slow passage across the TOM complex in the outer mitochondrial membrane
favor aggregation of mitochondrial precursor proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Neupert1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Esaki1">[60]</xref>,
and mistargeting of overexpressed hydrophobic proteins also leads to the formation
of stable cytosolic aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Kopito1">[49]</xref>.
Likewise, we observed that high SCaMC-1L expression, obtained by a 5-fold
increase in the amount of expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g006">Figure
6B</xref>) or longer times (48–72 h) after transfection (not shown),
resulted in a higher frequency of cells showing cytosolic aggregates. This
was reminiscent of the events occurring during spermatogenesis, where a large
increase of SCaMC-1L expression occurred at the time of round spermatids emergence,
and strong SCaMC-1L immunoreactivity appeared associated with the CBs in these
cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g003">Figures 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g004">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g005">5</xref>).</p>

        <p>Based on sequence conservation, mitochondrial SCaMC-1L is probably a mitochondrial
ATP-Mg/Pi carrier. In fact, murine SCaMC-1L orthologs show high degree of
homology with SCaMC-1, including the residues proposed to be involved in substrate
interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Robinson1">[34]</xref>). However,
its transporter function has not been investigated. SCaMC-1L adds to the large

        <p>A most remarkable aspect of SCaMC-1L is its location at the CB. In addition
to RNA-binding proteins and TDRD proteins, the CB contains proteins from different
cellular compartments as histones, actin, glycolytic (LDH, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Haraguchi2">[31]</xref>) and mitochondrial (cytochrome
c<sub>T</sub>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Hess1">[29]</xref>)
proteins as well as aggresomal markers, such as Hsp70, ubiquitin and ubiquitin-conjugating
enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Yokota1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Haraguchi2">[31]</xref>, suggesting
an aggresome-like role for this structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Yokota1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Haraguchi2">[31]</xref>. In SCaMC-1L
expressing cells, perinuclear SCaMC-1L aggregates exhibit some of the hallmarks
described for cellular aggresomes namely as microtubule-dependent formation,
co-location with γ-tubulin at the MTOC and the presence of anti-ubiquitin
positive signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g007">Figure 7D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-GarcaMata1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Johnston1">[64]</xref>, indicating
that these aggregates mimic SCaMC-1L behavior in male germ cells. Aggresomes
are not only stress responses to misfolded proteins. “Physiological
aggresomes” have been shown to play a role in inactivation of iNOS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Pandit1">[65]</xref>, or in the
regulation of cardiomyocyte cell cycle by cyclin D2SV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Sun1">[66]</xref>. It is possible that during
spermatogenesis, SCaMC-1L could favor the recruitment or co-aggregation of
components from mitochondria or other subcellular origins by transporting
them to the CB.</p>
        <p>Another possibility is that SCaMC-1L through its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding
domains can participate in the enrichment of calcium ions observed in the
CB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Yokota1">[26]</xref>.
A similar function has been proposed for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-binding
proteins BASP1 and MARCKS recently identified as CB components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Mosevitsky1">[67]</xref>. Alternatively, SCaMC-1L
could be also a structural component of the CB. In transiently transfected
cells, perinuclear SCaMC-1L aggregates do not form a compact structure but
fibrous aggregates as occurs for the CB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040470.s003">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Fawcett1">[28]</xref>).
Interestingly, in primates (human and chimpanzee), where <italic>SCaMC-1L</italic>
counterparts have undergone rearrangement becoming non functional, the CB
appears to be formed by small particles dispersed in the cytoplasm instead
of one single and large aggregate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Chuma1">[27]</xref>.
Human <italic>SCaMC-1L</italic>, LOC727941, is pseudogenized due to a nonsense
mutation in exon 6 and the lack of sequences corresponding to mouse exons
2 and 3. In chimpanzee genome we have detected a constitutional deletion affecting
exons 5–10 of the <italic>SCaMC-1L</italic> counterpart.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, during post-meiotic male germ cell differentiation,
transcription ceases whereas translation is delayed, and consequently, it
is possible that SCaMC-1L could be transiently accumulated in the CB until
its inclusion in the mitochondria of spermatids. Similarly, after CB disassembly,
some CB constituents migrate appearing in mature spermatids associated to
different structures of the middle piece of flagellum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Shang1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Mosevitsky1">[67]</xref>.</p>

        <p>The finding of this fifth SCaMC paralog makes the ATP-Mg/Pi carriers the
most represented MC subfamily in mammals. Only the ADP/ATP translocases have
undergone a similar expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Traba2">[11]</xref>.
Although murine SCaMC-1L shows high similarity with its closest paralog SCaMC-1,
around 75% at the amino acid level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g001">Figure
1B</xref>), there is a higher rate of amino-acid divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040470-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), due to a higher rates non-synonymous
(<italic>Ka</italic>) nucleotide substitution rates, about 4.8 fold, in mammalian
SCaMC-1L than in their corresponding SCaMC-1 paralogs. This agrees with the
accelerated divergence commonly observed in one of the copies of duplicated
gene pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040470-Force1">[68]</xref>.
It is reasonable to assume that the accelerated divergence detected in SCaMC-1L
paralogs enabled the acquisition of new properties, maybe related to its aggregation-prone
features, advantageous for mammalian spermatogenesis.</p>
