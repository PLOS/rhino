          <title>Objective</title>
          <p>To elucidate the pathophysiology of SCAD deficient patients who have a
unique neurological phenotype, among fatty acid oxidation disorders, with
early developmental delay, CNS malformations, intractable seizures, myopathy
and clinical signs suggesting oxidative stress.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We studied skin fibroblast cultures from patients homozygous for ACADS
common variant c.625G&gt;A (n = 10), compound heterozygous
for c.625G&gt;A/c.319C&gt;T (n = 3) or homozygous for
pathogenic c.319C&gt;T (n = 2) and c.1138C&gt;T (n = 2)
mutations compared to fibroblasts from patients with carnitine palmitoyltransferase
2 (CPT2) (n = 5), mitochondrial trifunctional protein
(MTP)/long-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) (n = 7),
and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiencies (n = 4)
and normal controls (n = 9). All were exposed to 50 µM
menadione at 37°C. Additonal conditions included exposure to 39°C
and/or hypoglycemia. Time to 100% cell death was confirmed with trypan
blue dye exclusion. Experiments were repeated with antioxidants (Vitamins
C and E or N-acetylcysteine), Bezafibrate or glucose and temperature rescue.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>The most significant risk factor for vulnerability to menadione-induced
oxidative stress was the presence of a FAO defect. SCADD fibroblasts were
the most vulnerable compared to other FAO disorders and controls, and were
similarly affected, independent of genotype. Cell death was exacerbated by
hyperthermia and/or hypoglycemia. Hyperthermia was a more significant independent
risk factor than hypoglycemia. Rescue significantly prolonged survival. Incubation
with antioxidants and Bezafibrate significantly increased viability of SCADD
fibroblasts.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Interpretation</title>
          <p>Vulnerability to oxidative stress likely contributes to neurotoxicity of
SCADD regardless of <italic>ACADS</italic> genotype and is significantly exacerbated
by hyperthermia. We recommend rigorous temperature control in SCADD patients
during acute illness. Antioxidants and Bezafibrate may also prove instrumental
in their management.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cellular energy metabolism is largely sustained by mitochondrial β-oxidation
of fatty acids when carbohydrate stores are depleted after fasting or prolonged
exercise. Whereas the clinical presentations of long- and medium-chain fatty
acid oxidation disorders (FAODs) are primarily of hepatic or cardiac dysfunction,
short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD) (OMIM # 201470) is predominantly
neurological in presentation with developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia
and myopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Tein1">[2]</xref>. Thirty-five
SCAD gene (<italic>ACADS</italic>) inactivating mutations have been described
in this autosomal recessive disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-vanMaldegem1">[3]</xref>. The
molecular phenomenon of the common <italic>ACADS</italic> variations, c.625G&gt;A
and c.511C&gt;T in SCADD is unique. These variations are identified in SCADD
patients, but also in various general populations at allelic frequencies of
22%–43% and 3%–8% respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Corydon1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-vanMaldegem2">[7]</xref>. The
biochemical consequences are SCAD protein misfolding and aggregation described
in <italic>in vitro</italic> mitochondrial import studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen2">[8]</xref>, which correlate poorly
with clinical severity. Patients with the <italic>ACADS</italic> gene spectrum
may remain asymptomatic or have muscle and neuronal toxicity. The speculated
role of additional gene and/or environmental modifiers needs to be better
understood.</p>
      <p>We studied a girl with progressive limb-girdle myopathy, ptosis, facial
weakness and progressive external ophthalmoplegia and features overlapping
with mitochondrial Complex I deficiency including cataracts and cardiomyopathy,
confirmed to have SCADD with homozygosity for c.319 C&gt;T mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Tein2">[9]</xref>. As a result
of her myopathy, she became wheelchair-dependent by 5 years of age. Independent
1 year trials of a high carbohydrate/low fat diet, L-carnitine, and riboflavin
did not improve her strength. Her total plasma aldehydes by GC/MS were significantly
elevated at 2997.6 nM, (controls 2041.3±228.3, n = 12) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Zolkipli1">[10]</xref>. A comparable
rise was reported in complex I deficiency (3377.8±595.7, n = 14).
We thus instituted a trial of Vitamins C 200 mg twice a day and E 400 IU daily.
After 6 months, she had a 6-fold increase in endurance time on sustained deltoid
abduction.</p>
      <p>This supported our speculation that increased oxidative stress is a pathogenetic
mechanism in SCADD. Mitochondria are a major site of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production, which are pathologic when excessive. Mitochondrial dysfunction
with increased ROS secondary to SCADD could explain the overlapping clinical
features of complex I and SCADD as seen in our patient. The possible association
between SCADD and oxidative stress in vitro has been investigated. EMA inhibits
mitochondrial creatine kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Schuck1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Leipnitz1">[12]</xref>, increases
lipid and protein oxidation products, and decreases glutathione (GSH) levels
in rat cerebral cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Schuck2">[13]</xref>.
In human skeletal muscle, EMA inhibits electron transport at complexes I–III
and II–III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Barschak1">[14]</xref>.
Given that the respiratory chain (RC) may generate excessive ROS from defective
electron transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Boveris1">[15]</xref>,
at complex I and Complex III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Boveris2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Turrens1">[17]</xref>, we speculate
that EMA accumulation may contribute to oxidative stress and the neurological
symptoms in SCADD patients by this mechanism. Furthermore, ROS reportedly
affects the permeability of the blood brain barrier, enhancing neuronal vulnerability
to ROS toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pun1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The second possible mechanism is a direct consequence of the SCAD protein
misfolding. The mitochondrial RC produces superoxides or hydroxyl radicals
(OH<sup>−</sup>) from the interaction of molecular oxygen with semi-quinone
or -flavone species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Takeshige1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Sies1">[20]</xref>. SCAD is an
FAD-linked dehydrogenase, and a defect in SCAD function, due to misfolding
and defective interaction with functional partners e.g. electron transfer
flavoprotein (ETF), may thus lead to the production of superoxides in proximity
to sites of semi-flavone production.</p>
      <p>A third potential mechanism relates to cellular antioxidant status. Oxidative
stress is due to an imbalance between excessive ROS generation and antioxidant
capacity, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Sies1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Duthie1">[22]</xref>. The two
intracellular SOD enzymes are intramitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase
(SOD2) and cytosolic copper zinc SOD (SOD1). A recent proteomic analysis of
mitochondria from c.625G&gt;A homozygous patient fibroblasts (n = 4)
revealed reduced SOD2 protein and mRNA expression compared to controls (n = 6),
rendering them more vulnerable to oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen3">[23]</xref>.
Sequencing of the SOD2 gene did not demonstrate abnormalities, suggesting
possible intrinsic dysregulation of SOD2.</p>
      <p>Therefore oxidative stress in SCADD could be the result of associated biochemical
abnormalities combined with intrinsic antioxidant dysfunction and exogenous
stressors. We plan to first identify the selective vulnerability to oxidative
stress, <italic>in vitro</italic>, in SCADD patient fibroblasts by exposure
to menadione, a free radical amplifier, both with and without stressors. Menadione
generates ROS through redox cycling, and has been shown to decrease mitochondrial
membrane potential and trigger cytochrome c redistribution to the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Duthie1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Hockenbery1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Loor1">[25]</xref>. Multiple redundant cell death
pathways are activated by menadione, and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)
plays an essential role in mediating each of them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Loor1">[25]</xref>.
As stressors, we have chosen hyperthermia at 39°C, which increases SCAD
protein aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen2">[8]</xref>,
and hypoglycemia, which limits the cellular bioenergetic source and puts further
stress on an already dysfunctional FAO pathway. Both of these stressors are
common well-recognized exogenous triggers for catabolic crisis in FAO disorders.
We will then test the therapeutic efficacy of specific pathophysiology-based
treatment interventions.</p>
      <p>We recognize that the extrapolation of cellular pathophysiologic mechanisms
from fibroblasts to neuronal tissue is suboptimal, however this is generally
the primary and often only patient cell type available to study <italic>in
vitro</italic>. We plan to compare the results from SCAD deficient fibroblasts
to those with medium and long-chain ACAD deficiencies. The family of ACAD
deficiencies have similarities such as intermittent metabolic crises with
hypoketotic hypoglycemia and clinical variability. The long-chain ACAD deficiencies
present with hepatic, cardiac and skeletal muscle symptoms and signs. Medium-chain
ACAD deficiencies present with hepatic features, whereas SCAD deficiency is
primarily neurological/neuromuscular in presentation. Based on our index case,
we plan to study the relative effect of oxidative stress in the short-, medium-,
and long-chain ACAD deficiencies at a cellular level in order to determine
whether this is a selective mechanistic pathway that contributes to the chronic
neurotoxicity in SCADD.</p>

no consistent genotype-phenotype correlations have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen2">[8]</xref>, therefore all 17 patient
cell lines of varying genotypes were included in one group. Each cell line
underwent menadione exposure with or without glucose (hypoglycemia), and at
37°C or 39°C (hyperthermia) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017534-g001">Fig.

SCADD patient fibroblasts compared to controls under each of the 4 conditions,
p&lt;0.001 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017534.s003">Table

more vulnerable compared to controls under each of the four conditions, p&lt;0.05.
Menadione toxicity in the CPT2/MTP patient fibroblasts was comparable to that
in the SCADD patient fibroblasts, p&gt;0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017534.s003">Table S3</xref>). The time to 100% death in
the MCADD cell lines was longer than in the control cells (625G/G and 625
G/A) only under physiological conditions, p&lt;0.05, but was not significantly
different when glucose deprivation and/or hyperthermia were added, p&gt;0.05.
In addition, MCADD fibroblasts were not significantly different from the 625
A/A controls under all four experimental conditions, p&gt;0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017534.s003">Table S3</xref>). In comparison of the controls, the

        <p>In summary, the SCADD and CPT2/MTP deficient fibroblasts showed a significant
increase in viability with all 3 treatments. NAC had the most significant
effect. The SCADD and CPT2/MTP fibroblasts were the most vulnerable to menadione-
induced oxidative stress, suggesting that these cell lines had higher levels
of cellular ROS. Therefore, the anti-oxidant intervention was most significant
in these groups. The response to Bezafibrate in SCADD fibroblasts suggests
there may be some restoration of short-chain FAO by PPAR regulation of the <italic>ACADS</italic>
gene, thereby reducing the biochemical abnormalities arising from the SCAD
block and the resultant vulnerability to oxidative stress.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We pursued the hypothesis that SCADD patients may have increased vulnerability
to oxidative stress, based on the clinical and biochemical features of our
index case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Tein2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Zolkipli1">[10]</xref>, the published

consequences of the SCAD protein misfolding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen2">[8]</xref>,
and our recent demonstration of antioxidant dysfunction in SCADD fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen3">[23]</xref>. The relationship
between abnormal FAO and secondary mitochondrial dysfunction is likely multifactorial.
Our studies provide evidence of increased vulnerability to oxidative stress
in SCADD fibroblasts, with exacerbation by hyperthermia and hypoglycemia.
This exacerbation is of clinical relevance given that individuals with <italic>ACADS</italic>
gene spectrum e.g those identified on newborn screening may remain asymptomatic
until exposed to a triggering illness. This exacerbation is also concordant
with mitochondrial import studies showing increased aggregation of SCAD proteins
with hyperthermia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen2">[8]</xref>.
Given that both protein aggregation and ROS production are aggravated by hyperthermia,
this further highlights the interrelationship between these two mechanisms.
The resulting oxidative imbalance from increased ROS production and from antioxidant
dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen3">[23]</xref>
may thereby exceed a subclinical threshold in affected individuals, giving
rise to clinical disease. The results of our studies are therefore concordant
with our hypothesis of increased vulnerability to oxidative stress in the
pathogenetic mechanism of SCADD. These results also suggest an interweaving
of pathogenetic mechanisms in SCADD namely increased oxidative stress, with
the previous studies which demonstrated antioxidant dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen3">[23]</xref> and protein misfolding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen2">[8]</xref>. Furthermore,
given that the SCAD protein is nuclear-encoded, the demonstrated abnormalities
in cultured skin fibroblasts can be extrapolated to other cell types in the
central and peripheral nervous system and likely contribute to the neurological
and neuromuscular phenotypes of SCAD deficiency.</p>
      <p>It is possible that significant oxidative imbalance is required prior to
the manifestation of clinical symptoms. This may explain the discrepancy between
the frequency of common SCAD variations in the general population, and the
prevalence of clinically manifest SCADD. The vulnerability to oxidative stress
appears to be independent of the <italic>ACADS</italic> genotype, concordant
with previous reports of inconsistent genotype-phenotype correlations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-vanMaldegem3">[27]</xref>. A further example is
the contrasting clinical phenotypes of c.625G&gt;A homozygosity which may
be explained by our recent description of decreased SOD2 expression in the
affected patient vs ‘asymptomatic control’ fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen3">[23]</xref>. In addition, exogenous
stressors, such as hypoglycemia and fever, may influence the clinical phenotype.
Oxidative stress with hydrogen peroxide, under heat stress, has been shown
to impair the heat stress response (HSP40/HSP70), delay unfolded protein recovery
and enhance loss of mitochondrial membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Adachi1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In mitochondrial Complex I deficiency with the cardiomyopathy and cataracts
phenotype, it has been proposed that significant induction of SOD2 may result
from a temporarily much elevated superoxide production rate in the presence
of an abnormally reduced redox state, as occurs in anoxia reperfusion injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pitkanen1">[29]</xref>. Superoxide
specifically attacks (4Fe-4S) centres in Complex I and II resulting in release
of free iron in mitochondria and cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Flint1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Fazzone1">[31]</xref>, which generates
excessive OH<sup>−</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Fridovich2">[32]</xref>.
This could be the mechanism in our SCADD fibroblasts, with exacerbation by
heat stress due to protein unfolding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pedersen2">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Oxidative stress is likely to trigger pro-apoptotic signaling cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Seiler1">[33]</xref>. Of the 7
glutathione peroxidases in mammals, GPx4 is specific for phospholipid hydroperoxides
in membranes, and is shown to be significant for neuronal survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Seiler1">[33]</xref>. GPx4 senses and translates
oxidative stress into a 12/15-lipoxygenase dependent- and apoptosis-inducing
factor-mediated cell death pathway. In GPx4-knockout cells, lipid peroxidative
injury was the key mediator of cell death and was efficiently prevented by
Vitamin E. Vitamins E and C have been reported to neutralize free radicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Gutteridge1">[34]</xref>. We evaluated
these effects at physiological plasma concentrations. NAC has ROS scavenging
actions, but is also a precursor for glutathione synthesis, and thus essential
for the effects of GPx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Kelly1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Intervention with Bezafibrate resulted in significant improvement in viability
only in the SCADD and CPT2/MTPD patient cell lines under all 4 experimental
conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017534.s005">Table

the SCADD and CPT2/MTPD cells, but also in the MCADD cells at 37°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017534.s006">Table S6</xref>).
NAC however, was significantly effective in improving viability in all patient
cell lines under all 4 experimental conditions , as well as the normal controls
under 3 of the experimental conditions at 0.5 mM, and in all 4 experimental
conditions at 5.0 mM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017534.s007">Table
S7</xref>). In a Bonferroni comparison, the effect of NAC 0.5 or 5 mM was
significantly more effective in improving cellular viability than AO or Bezafibrate
under all experimental conditions in the SCADD cell lines, p&lt;0.001 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017534.s008">Tables S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017534.s009">S9</xref>). This
suggests that in SCADD cells, NAC has more extensive antioxidant actions than
vitamin C and E or Bezafibrate. In the other cell lines, this difference in
effect was less consistent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017534.s008">Tables

      <p>The mechanism for Bezafibrate reduction of oxidative stress is uncertain.
Bezafibrate increases Complex I, III and IV enzyme activities in control cells
and significantly increases activity of deficient RC complexes in certain
RC deficient cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Bastin1">[36]</xref>.
As EMA may interfere with Complexes I and III, leading to ROS generation,
Bezafibrate may counteract, in part, these effects. Whether Bezafibrate restores
short-chain FAO requires further studies.</p>

has been investigated. In rat brain, octanoic and decanoic acids were shown
to uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, provoke mitochondrial
cytochrome c release, increase lipid and protein oxidation damage and decrease
GSH levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Schuck3">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Schuck4">[38]</xref>. Our small
number of MCADD patient fibroblasts survived significantly longer compared
to 625G/G and 625G/A controls only at 37°C and in glucose-containing medium,
p&lt;0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017534.s003">Table
S3</xref>). With the addition of high temperature and/or glucose deprivation
however, the MCADD cells were as sensitive to menadione-induced toxicity as
these control cells, p&gt;0.05. Furthermore, the MCADD fibroblasts were not
significantly different to the 625A/A controls under all four experimental
conditions. Therefore the MCADD fibroblasts did not appear to have a similar
degree of risk for increased vulnerability to oxidative stress as seen in
the SCADD and TFP/LCHADD fibroblasts.</p>
      <p>Long-chain defect fibroblasts were more vulnerable to oxidative stress,
comparable to the SCADD patient fibroblasts, p&gt;0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017534-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017534.s003">Table S3</xref>). This may be attributable to the
accumulation of palmitoyl-CoA and palmitoylcarnitine shown to have detergent
properties on isolated canine myocytic sarcolemmal membranes and to potentiate
ROS-induced lipid membrane peroxidative injury in ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Mak1">[39]</xref>. Further, long-chain acyl-CoA's
are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Pande1">[40]</xref>, which catalyzes
exchange of ADP and ATP across the inner mitochondrial membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Vignais1">[41]</xref> and is the overall rate-limiting
step in oxidative phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0017534-Duee1">[42]</xref>.
Inhibition of ANT1 would lead to increased ROS.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, there appear to be multifactorial mechanisms involved in
the pathophysiology of clinical disease in SCAD deficiency including intrinsic
factors which predispose to vulnerability to oxidative stress and protein
unfolding, as well as exogenous stressors such as elevated temperature and
hypoglycemia. Certain of these factors may also contribute to the pathophysiology
of long-chain FAODs. The reversal of cellular toxicity <italic>in vitro</italic>
with antioxidants and bezafibrate supports the role of these agents in maintaining
mitochondrial homeostasis. We advocate rigorous management of fever in SCADD
patients, avoidance of adverse conditions such as fasting, and prompt rescue
during a catabolic crisis. Antioxidants and Bezafibrate may prove to be useful
therapeutic agents for the prevention and amelioration of the neurological
morbidity seen in SCAD deficiency.</p>
