The difference in survival between the \u003citalic\u003ecft1\u003c/italic\u003eΔ mutant and the WT strain was significant based on a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (\u003citalic\u003ep\u003c/italic\u003e \u0026lt; 0.0001).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(B) In a separate experiment, the virulence of the \u003citalic\u003ecft1\u003c/italic\u003eΔ \u003citalic\u003ecft2\u003c/italic\u003eΔ double mutant was compared with that of the WT strain and the \u003citalic\u003ecft1\u003c/italic\u003eΔ mutant, again with 10 mice per inoculation. A second, independently isolated, double mutant showed a similar attenuation of virulence. All of the virulence tests were performed at least twice. The difference in survival between the \u003citalic\u003ecft1\u003c/italic\u003eΔ mutant and the WT strain was significant (\u003citalic\u003ep\u003c/italic\u003e \u0026lt; 0.0001), as was the difference between the \u003citalic\u003ecft1\u003c/italic\u003eΔ mutant and the \u003citalic\u003ecft1\u003c/italic\u003eΔ \u003citalic\u003ecft2\u003c/italic\u003eΔ double mutant (\u003citalic\u003ep\u003c/italic\u003e \u0026lt; 0.0001).\u003c/p\u003e",
