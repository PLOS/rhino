Upon differentiation of various tissues and cell lines from different organisms, the expression of the proliferation module is more uniformly suppressed, while the differentiation module is upregulated in a tissue- and species-specific manner. Our results indicate that even at the tissue and organism levels, proliferation and differentiation modules may correspond to two alternative states of the molecular network and may reflect a universal symbiotic relationship in a multicellular organism. Our analyses further predict that the proteins mediating the interactions between these modules may serve as modulators at the proliferation/differentiation switch.\u003c/p\u003e",

Even without integrating a PPI network, a careful manual search can identify loosely aggregated gene expression clusters of 783 and 1,276 genes that significantly overlap with the P and D modules. When the PCC cutoff is \u0026gt;0.7, no gene cluster that has more than 100 genes can be identified as significantly overlapping with the D module. Input gene sets together with the number of genes in each set (in parentheses) are listed as the row headers on the left. The sizes of the clusters identified under various PCC cutoffs or without a PPI network are listed as the row headers on the right, and those of the original P, D, N, and S modules are listed on the column headers on the top. The number of genes overlapping between the original and latter examined clusters is indicated in each cell of the matrix; the intensity of the background color of a cell reflects the overlap significance as –log (\u003citalic\u003ep-\u003c/italic\u003evalue) by Fisher exact test normalized by standard deviation among all the cluster overlaps examined, which equals 44. (B) The fractions of P–D genes within the NP network at various |PCC| cutoffs used to extract the NP network from the extended PPI network. A maximal fraction is achieved at |PCC| cutoffs of 0.45 and 0.5 (yellow bars). Because some N module genes are merged into the P modules at |PCC| cutoffs of 0.45 and 0.5, the fractions of the module genes that overlap with the original NP network P and D modules are also plotted to exclude the potential bias introduced by the inclusion of some N genes. The fraction of P and D module genes overlapping with the original P and D modules (blue bars) display a similar trend to the fraction of total genes in each module (yellow bars).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(342 KB PDF)\u003c/p\u003e",
