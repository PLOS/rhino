Sorted cells were then analyzed for polarization in rBM and the resulting acini examined by bright-field and epifluorescence microscopy. GFP over-expression permitted polarization (left panels). However, acini over-expressing TUBG1-GFP were unable to polarize (representative acini at bottom left in the right panels). Blasticidin-resistant clones with low TUBG1-GFP expression formed normal acini with lumen, as indicated by DAPI (top right acini in the bright-field image).

(C) Position T703 of RHAMM is an AURKA substrate in vitro. When normalized to reactions lacking substrate, the combination of recombinant AURKA, ATP, and a T703-containing peptide substrate (acetyl-CKENFALK(T)PLKEGNT-amide) resulted in time-dependent consumption of ATP as measured by luminescence.
