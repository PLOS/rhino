               <title>Background</title>
               <p>One of the core concepts of the PLoS journals is that what happens after a paper
                  is published is as important as what occurred before it was published. To support
                  that, PLoS is encouraging ongoing review and discussion of articles with a number
                  of post-publication tools. These tools allow you to add notes and publicly comment
                  on the online articles. This article describes the post-publication tools of the
                  PLoS journals and provides a place for you to experiment and play. The commentary
                  left on this sandbox article, and the text itself, will be removed on a periodic
                  basis.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>The PLoS Web site employs a system for the assessment of articles that combines pre- and
            post-publication peer review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000000-PLoS1">[1]</xref>.</p>
         <sec id="s1a">
            <title>Notes, Comments and Ratings</title>
            <p>There are three major components to the post-publication review:</p>
            <list list-type="number">
               <list-item>
                  <p>Notes: Notes apply to a specific point in the Web version of the article text
                     and should be used to highlight a minor point, to make additions or
                     clarifications, or to identify and link to material, including more extensive
                     discussions, presented elsewhere. There isn’t a word limit on these notes, but
                     when highlighted, the note is truncated after a few lines with a link through
                     to the full note. Anyone, including authors, can reply to a note so that a
                     conversation can develop around a specific point in the article.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>Comments: Comments are of a more general nature and can also be added to the
                     article, leading to threaded discussions concerning the content, conclusions,
                     and consequences of a specific article. Comments are not attached to any
                     specific part of the article and they can be extended by replying to any
                     comment in the discussion thread. This allows for multiple branching threads of
                     discussion.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>Ratings: Users can assign individual ratings to articles, which are then
                     aggregated to provide overall ratings and rankings of articles. Users are not
                     allowed to rate more than once, but can revise their rating. For more details,
                     see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000000-PLoS2">[2]</xref>.</p>

            <title>How to Add and View Notes</title>
            <p>To make a Note, first make sure you are logged into the Web site. Highlight the text
               to be annotated, and then click the "Add a note to the text" link in the right-hand
               navigation menu of the article. The drop-down list should already have “Note”
               selected. If it is not, then select “Note” from the drop-down list. Enter a title and
               text for your Note in the appropriate boxes. When you are satisfied with the text,
               click "Post" to attach the Note to the article. Any correctly formed URLs in the Note
               text field will automatically become working links. </p>
            <p>Notes can be started at any point within the text, but for ease of reading we ask
               that you do not begin Notes in the middle of words. We advise that longer Notes are
               first written in a word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they
               are copied and pasted into the Note field.</p>
            <p>Notes are represented by the small blue "clouds" within the online text. The number
               in the cloud indicates the number of Notes that begin at that point in the text. To
               see what selection of text is associated with a Note, run the cursor over the cloud,
               and the text will be transiently highlighted. Click on the cloud to view the title,
               date, contributor, and first 250 text characters of a Note. To view the complete text
               of a Note or the citation information of a Note, click the "View/respond to this"
               link to view the full text.</p>

            <p>To add a general Comment about the article as a whole, first make sure you are logged
               into the Web site. To create a Comment, click the "Make a general comment" link in
               the right-hand navigation menu of the article. Enter a title and text for your
               comment in the appropriate boxes.</p>
            <p>We advise that Comments are first written in a word-processing program that allows
               for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into the Comment field. When you
               are satisfied with the text, click "Post" to attach the Comment to the article. Any

            <p>Authors and other users can post two kinds of Corrections: Minor Corrections and
               Formal Corrections. Minor Corrections indicate small errors and clarifications to the
               article, whereas Formal Corrections are reserved for errors that significantly affect
               the utility or understanding of the article. Formal Corrections are also sent to
               PubMed Central and PubMed. In both cases, the decision to indicate a posting as a
               Minor or Formal Correction is the responsibility of PLoS staff.</p>

               text to be corrected, and then click the "Add a note to the text" link in the
               right-hand navigation menu of the article. Select “Correction” from the drop-down
               list. Enter a title and text for your Correction in the appropriate boxes. When you
               are satisfied with the text, click "Post" to attach the Correction to the
               article.</p>
            <p>The Correction will initially appear as a Note but will be promptly reviewed by PLoS
               staff. After the Note is reviewed, it will either stay as a Note or be changed to a
               Minor Correction or Formal Correction.</p>
            <p>Once a Note is changed to a Correction, the Correction is represented by a small red
               triangle "cloud" within the online text. The number in the cloud indicates the number
               of Corrections that begin at that point in the text. To see what selection of text is
               associated with a Correction, run the cursor over the cloud, and the text will be
               transiently highlighted. Click on the cloud to view the title, date, contributor, and
               first 250 text characters of a Correction. To view the complete text of a Correction
               or the citation information of a Correction, click the "View/respond to this" link to
               view the full text.</p>
            <p>Formal Corrections are also listed above the title of the article.. The title of the
               Formal Correction and a link to the Formal Corrections will appear in this block.</p>

               pasted into the comment field. When you are satisfied with the text, click "Post" to
               attach the response to the Note, Comment or Correction. Any correctly formed URLs in
               the response text field will automatically become working links.</p>
            <p>Following this procedure, an unlimited number of branching threads can be anchored to

            <title>Rating Categories</title>
            <p>The PLoS Web site allows users to rate articles for subjective "quality". Scientific
               work can be measured on a number of scales. To reflect this, research articles can be
               rated in three separate categories: Insight, Reliability, and Style. Rating is done
               on a 1 to 5 scale with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest rating.</p>
            <list list-type="number">
               <list-item>
                  <p>Insight: This provides a measure of how thought-provoking a user found an
                     article or how much it advances our scientific understanding. The scale for
                     Insight ranges from 1, Bland, a report which provides no more than an
                     incremental advance on the published literature; to 5, Profound, a report which
                     substantially deepens or alters current thinking.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>Reliability: This provides a measure of how secure a user feels the results and
                     conclusion in a study are. The scale for Reliability ranges from 1, Tenuous,
                     the study is preliminary and will need confirmation; to 5, Unassailable, the
                     results are of high quality, the reasoning is tight, and the conclusions are
                     completely solid.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>Style: This provides a measure of how well performed and presented a user
                     considers a study to be. The scale for Style ranges from 1, Crude, the
                     technical accomplishment and presentation of the study is adequate at best; to
                     5, Elegant, the study satisfyingly presents the results of technically
                     accomplished and expertly executed experiments.</p>
               </list-item>
            </list>
            <p>Users can rate research articles in any or all categories; the ratings given are
               combined to give an overall rating from that user. Note that Front Matter articles,
               such as Editorials, Perspectives, and Reviews, can only be given a single overall
               rating.</p>
            <p>Ratings from all users are combined to give average ratings in each category and a
               combined overall rating. The number of users who have rated an article is also
               displayed.</p>
            <p>Users can also supply comments to accompany their rating of an article. These can be
               used to explain the ratings given. Unlike other forms of comment, rating comments
               cannot be used as the beginning of a discussion thread. The comment field is
               optional; however, comments cannot be made unless the user also rates the article in
               at least one category.</p>

         <sec id="s3a">
            <title>Question 1: I have just read a peer-reviewed article in one of the PLoS journals.
               What do I do next?</title>
            <p>Rate the article - tell us what you think of it by giving it a star ranking (1-5).
               Post a note and/or a comment onthe article. This will help build on the article's
               research and start a discussion with your peers.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="s3b">
            <title>Question 2: But I am not an expert in the field!</title>
            <p>That is perfectly OK - nobody can be an expert on everything. But you have read this
               article because you were interested in the topic and understood some, most, or all of
               the article. Thus, you are an educated, informed reader. A comment or question that
               you post will be worthwhile and of interest to others.</p>
            <p>The authors, referees and academic editors of PLoS articles are encouraged to respond
               to your c omments and questions. They have put a lot of hard work into the manuscript
               and will appreciate compliments as well as polite criticisms and questions from both
               experts and non-experts.</p>
            <p>Comments that are entirely off-topic, or offensive, or posted by purveyors of
               pseudo/non/anti-science, will be deleted. If you notice an inappropriate comment,
               please flag the comment so that we can evaluate it and act accordingly.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="s3c">
            <title>Question 3: Q: I think the article is well done, well written and complete. I
               have nothing to ask, critique or add to it. I also think that the paper adds another
               piece to the puzzle, is not controversial and does not challenge existing theory.
               Good, but not exciting. Should I say anything?</title>
            <p>Yes. PLoS welcomes such articles. You may choose to rate the article high on
               Reliability and Style and lower on Insight if that is how you feel. But do post a
               comment stating your opinion nonetheless. Congratulate the authors on good work and
               note that you think it is a valuable addition to the existing body of knowledge
               without being revolutionary. </p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="s3d">
            <title>Question 4: I think the article is challenging the current dogma in ways that
               make me excited about the new view. But I may have quibbles with some
               details.</title>
            <p>Rate the article, perhaps giving somewhat lower marks on Reliability and Style and
               higher on Insight, if that is how you feel. Post a comment that shows your excitement
               about the work, as well as voices your minor concerns.</p>

            <title>Question 5: I think the article has a major problem, but I am afraid to challenge
               a big name in my field.</title>
            <p>Your nervousness is understandable. But if you believe that you have identified a
               real problem with the article and you feel confident , it is likely that other
               readers will feel the same. Be the first one to comment about it (try to use
               non-confrontational language such as 'could' not 'should' etc) and read the responses
               of others who may agree or disagree with you. On the PLoS journals, everyone is equal
               and everyone is expected to treat others with equal respect. Courage to challenge
               authorities will gain you a fair reputation among your peers.</p>

            <title>Question 6: What is in it for me? Why should I spend my time and expose myself to
               do this?</title>
            <p>Think of it in a long-term perspective. Post-publication review is likely to spread
               over time and become ubiquitous. Within a year or so, all PLoS journals will have
               this functionality. Other publishers are likely to follow suit. People who comment
               frequently and write valuable comments will build reputations over time. If you rate,
               note and comment on PLoS papers now, you will be one of the early adopters and will
               be recognized and respected for this in the future. </p>
            <p>Within a few months, there will be a new functionality implemented on PLoS articles,
               whereby users will be able to rate each others' comments. Hopefully, this rating
               system will be universal over all Open Access journals with post-publication reviews.
               Frequent quality commenting will help you build up a high rating score from your
               fellow commentators. In the future, this score will be a number that you could
               include in your CV and use for promotions, getting jobs, etc. Also, prolific
               commenting may result in offers for future scientific collaboration or employment.
               This has already happened to prolific commenters on science blogs and is even more
               likely to happen to prolific commenters on peer-reviewed articles.</p>
