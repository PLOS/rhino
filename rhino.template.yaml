# Configuration related to the taxonomic classification of articles.
#
# "server" and "thesaurus" specify the remote taxonomy server that will
# classify articles as they are ingested. If both are null, Rhino will skip the
# service call; it will still ingest articles, but will not write any
# categories for them at ingestion time.
#
# Any term that starts with a string in "categoryBlacklist" will be suppressed
# from all articles if the taxonomy service returns it. The "Locations" term is
# suppressed as a workaround for a problem where articles that mention
# geographic locations are over-aggressively categorized under "Earth
# sciences". See <https://developer.plos.org/jira/browse/AMEC-100>
